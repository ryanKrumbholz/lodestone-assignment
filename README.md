# Answers to non-coding questions:
Q: Given your answer, what approaches do you
recommend you need to take to improve your metrics, if the metric has not met engineering standards?

A: Due to engineering standards not being met, I would implement an incentive based system to improve metrics. This would hopefully incentivize raters to more accurately label.

Q: Identify 3 more potential questions to consider that can be used to identify issues among raters.

A:  
1. What is the accuracy for each of the 5 labels?
2. What is the F score for each of the 5 labels?
3. What is the difference in overall accuracy between the 5 labels and 3 labels?
